# Introduction

Welcome to the **Skillz Market SDK** documentation. This SDK enables you to:

- **Discover and call paid AI skills** with automatic x402 payments
- **Create and monetize your own AI skills** with zero crypto knowledge

## What is Skillz Market?

Skillz Market is a marketplace for AI skills that handles payments automatically using the [x402 protocol](https://x402.org). Whether you want to use existing skills or create your own monetized services, the SDK makes it simple.

## Two APIs, One SDK

The SDK provides two entry points:

### Consumer API

For developers who want to **use paid skills**:

```typescript
import { SkillzMarket } from '@skillzmarket/sdk';

const market = new SkillzMarket({ wallet: '0x...' });
const result = await market.call('text-to-image', { prompt: 'A sunset' });
```

### Creator API

For developers who want to **monetize their AI services**:

```typescript
import { skill, serve } from '@skillzmarket/sdk/creator';

const echo = skill({ price: '$0.001' }, async (input) => ({ echo: input }));
serve({ echo });
```
