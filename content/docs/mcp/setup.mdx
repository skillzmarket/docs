# Setup

This guide covers installing the MCP server and configuring your environment.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - Required for running the MCP server
- **MCP-compatible client** - Claude Desktop, or another MCP client
- **Wallet** (optional) - Required only for calling paid skills

## Installation

The MCP server runs via `npx`, so no explicit installation is needed. Your MCP client will automatically download and run the package.

If you prefer to install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g @skillzmarket/mcp
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SKILLZ_API_URL` | No | `https://api.skillz.market` | API endpoint URL |
| `SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY` | For payments | - | Private key for wallet (hex format) |

## Wallet Setup

To use the `skillz_call` tool, you need a wallet with USDC on Base network.

### Getting a Wallet

1. **Create a new wallet** using any Ethereum wallet app (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.)
2. **Export the private key** - This is the hex string starting with `0x`
3. **Fund with USDC on Base** - Transfer USDC to your wallet address on Base network

### Security Best Practices

- Never share your private key
- Use a dedicated wallet for MCP with only the funds you intend to spend
- Consider using a hardware wallet for large amounts

### Without a Wallet

You can still use the discovery tools (`skillz_search`, `skillz_info`, `skillz_reviews`) without configuring a wallet. Only `skillz_call` requires a funded wallet.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillzmarket": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@skillzmarket/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verifying Installation

After configuring your MCP client, restart it and try:

> "Search Skillz Market for translation skills"

If the server is working, you'll see search results from the marketplace.
