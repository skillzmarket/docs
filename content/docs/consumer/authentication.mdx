description: How to authenticate with Skillz Market using wallets or social login.

# Authentication

Skillz Market supports multiple authentication methods to make it easy for anyone to get started.

## Login Options

### Wallet Login

Connect directly with your existing crypto wallet:

- **MetaMask**
- **Coinbase Wallet**
- **WalletConnect** (supports 300+ wallets)
- **Rainbow**
- **And more...**

Your wallet address becomes your account identifier.

### Social Login

Sign in without a crypto wallet:

- **Google**
- **Twitter/X**
- **Discord**

When you use social login, Skillz Market automatically creates an **embedded wallet** for you. This wallet is:
- Linked to your social account
- Used for receiving payments (if you're a creator)
- Can be exported if needed

---

## How Authentication Works

### Web Dashboard

1. Click **Login** in the header
2. Choose wallet or social login
3. Complete the authentication flow
4. You're logged in with a session cookie

Sessions last 7 days and automatically refresh.

### SDK Authentication

The SDK uses your wallet's private key directly:

```typescript
import { SkillzMarket } from '@skillzmarket/sdk';

const market = new SkillzMarket({
  wallet: process.env.SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY,
});

// Authenticate for feedback/reviews
await market.authenticate();
```

Authentication is required for:
- Submitting reviews
- Rating skills

Not required for:
- Searching skills
- Calling skills (payment handles auth)
- Viewing skill details

## Embedded Wallets

When you sign in with Google, Twitter, or Discord:

1. Skillz Market (via Privy) creates an embedded wallet
2. The wallet is secured by your social login
3. You can use this wallet to receive payments as a creator
4. The wallet address is shown in your dashboard

### Exporting Your Embedded Wallet

If you want to use your embedded wallet elsewhere:

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click on your profile
3. Select "Export Wallet"
4. Follow the security prompts

## Sessions & Tokens

### Access Tokens

- Valid for 1 hour
- Stored in HTTP-only cookie
- Automatically refreshed

### Refresh Tokens

- Valid for 7 days
- Used to get new access tokens
- Stored in HTTP-only cookie with `/auth` path

### API Keys

For programmatic access without interactive login:

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Go to the **API Keys** tab
3. Create a new key
4. Use in `Authorization: Bearer sk_...` header

API keys are:
- Prefixed with `sk_` (creator) or `ck_` (consumer)
- Revocable at any time
- Tied to your account

## Authentication Flow

```
User                    Frontend                API
  |                        |                      |
  |-- Click Login -------->|                      |
  |                        |-- Privy Auth ------->|
  |<-- Privy Token --------|                      |
  |                        |-- POST /auth/privy ->|
  |                        |<-- JWT + Cookies ----|
  |                        |                      |
  |-- Make API Request --->|                      |
  |                        |-- Request + Cookie ->|
  |                        |<-- Response ---------|
```

## Switching Auth Methods

You can link multiple auth methods to the same account:

1. Log in with your current method
2. Go to Settings
3. Link additional login methods

This lets you use Google on your phone and MetaMask on desktop, both accessing the same account.

## Security

### What We Store

- Your wallet address (public)
- Encrypted session tokens
- API key hashes (not the actual keys)

### What We Don't Store

- Private keys (never sent to us)
- Social login passwords (handled by providers)
- Full API keys (only prefixes for identification)

### Best Practices

1. Use unique, strong passwords for social accounts
2. Enable 2FA on your wallet if supported
3. Regularly rotate API keys
4. Review active sessions in settings

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

- Clear cookies and try again
- Check if your wallet is locked
- Try a different browser

### "Session expired"

- Refresh the page to get a new token
- If issues persist, log out and back in

### Wallet Not Connecting

- Ensure your wallet extension is unlocked
- Check if the site is allowed in wallet settings
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
