# Payouts

When consumers call your skills, you earn USDC. This guide explains how payments flow to creators.

## How Payments Work

### x402 Direct Payments

Most skill calls use x402 protocol for direct peer-to-peer payments:

1. Consumer calls your skill
2. Your skill returns `402 Payment Required`
3. Consumer's wallet sends USDC to your payment address
4. Consumer retries with payment proof
5. Your skill executes and returns result

**You receive funds instantly** in your wallet.

### Balance-Based Payments

For consumers using the internal balance system:

1. Consumer pre-funds their balance
2. Consumer calls your skill
3. Skillz Market treasury handles the x402 payment
4. You receive funds via batch payout

---

## Payment Address

Your payment address is set per-skill and is where you receive USDC:

```typescript
import { skill, serve } from '@skillzmarket/sdk/creator';

const mySkill = skill({
  price: '$0.01',
}, async (input) => {
  return { result: 'done' };
});

serve({ mySkill }, {
  wallet: '0x...', // Your payment address
  register: {
    endpoint: 'https://your-server.com',
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

### Setting Payment Address

You can use:
- A hardware wallet address
- Any Ethereum address you control
- Your embedded wallet from social login

All payments are on **Base network** in **USDC**.

## Payout Status

For balance-based payments, payouts go through these stages:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Usage recorded, waiting for batch |
| `processing` | Transaction submitted to blockchain |
| `completed` | Funds arrived in your wallet |
| `failed` | Transaction failed (will be retried) |

Check payout status in your dashboard under the Analytics section.

## Payout Timing

### x402 Direct Payments

Instant. As soon as the transaction confirms (~2 seconds on Base).

### Balance-Based Payouts

Batched for gas efficiency:
- Small amounts accumulate
- Payouts process when threshold is reached
- Or on a regular schedule (daily/weekly)

---

## Viewing Earnings

### Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:
- Total revenue across all skills
- Revenue per skill
- Recent payment activity

### API

```bash
curl https://api.skillz.market/analytics/skill-uuid \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_..."
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "totalRevenue": "123.45",
  "callCount": 1234
}
```

## Tax Considerations

As a creator earning USDC, you may have tax obligations:

- Keep records of all payouts
- USDC is treated as income in most jurisdictions
- Consult a tax professional for your situation

The dashboard provides revenue history for tax reporting.

## Fees

### Platform Fee

Skillz Market charges **0%** platform fee during beta.

Future pricing will be announced with advance notice.

### Network Fees

Gas fees on Base are minimal (~$0.001 per transaction) and are:
- Paid by the consumer for x402 payments
- Absorbed by the platform for balance-based payouts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Received (x402)

1. Check the transaction on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org)
2. Verify your payment address is correct
3. Ensure the consumer's payment succeeded

### Payout Pending Too Long

Balance-based payouts may be delayed if:
- Amount is below threshold
- Network congestion
- System maintenance

Check the dashboard for status updates.

### Wrong Payment Address

If you set the wrong address:
1. Update your skill registration
2. New payments go to the new address
3. Previous payments cannot be redirected

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use a dedicated wallet** - Separate from personal funds
2. **Verify your address** - Test with a small payment first
3. **Monitor earnings** - Check dashboard regularly
4. **Secure your wallet** - Use hardware wallet for large amounts
5. **Keep records** - Export payment history for accounting
