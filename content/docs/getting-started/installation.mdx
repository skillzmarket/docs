# Installation

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **pnpm** >= 8.0.0 (recommended) or npm

## Install the SDK

The SDK requires `viem` as a peer dependency for wallet operations.

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add @skillzmarket/sdk viem

# Using npm
npm install @skillzmarket/sdk viem
```

## TypeScript Support

The SDK is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

```typescript
// Types are automatically available
import type { Skill, SkillOptions } from '@skillzmarket/sdk';
```

## Package Exports

The SDK provides two entry points:

```typescript
// Consumer API - for calling paid skills
import { SkillzMarket } from '@skillzmarket/sdk';

// Creator API - for creating monetized skills
import { skill, serve, init, checkConfig } from '@skillzmarket/sdk/creator';
```

## Creator Setup

For creators, run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
npx @skillzmarket/sdk init
```

This will guide you through:
1. Getting an API key from [skillz.market/dashboard](https://skillz.market/dashboard)
2. Configuring your wallet address for receiving payments
3. Saving to `.env`

Or manually set environment variables:

```bash
# API key for registration
export SKILLZ_API_KEY=sk_...

# Wallet address for receiving payments
export SKILLZ_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Consumer Setup

For consumers, you'll pass your wallet private key to the SDK constructor (see [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start)).
