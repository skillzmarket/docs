# Spending Wallets

A spending wallet is your dedicated wallet for calling paid skills. It holds USDC on Base network and is used by the SDK to make payments.

## What is a Spending Wallet?

Unlike your main wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.), a spending wallet is:

- **Dedicated** - Used only for Skillz Market
- **Self-custody** - You control the private key
- **Pre-funded** - Load it with USDC before calling skills
- **SDK-ready** - Works directly with the SDK and MCP server

## Why Use a Spending Wallet?

1. **Security** - Keep your main wallet separate from automated payments
2. **Budget control** - Only load what you want to spend
3. **SDK integration** - Private key can be stored in `.env` for automation
4. **Social login support** - Works even if you signed up with Google/Twitter

## Creating a Spending Wallet

### Via Web Dashboard

1. Go to [Dashboard](https://skillz.market/dashboard)
2. Click the **Wallet** tab
3. Click **Create Spending Wallet**
4. **Save your private key immediately** - it's only shown once!
5. Copy the `.env` format for your SDK setup

### What Happens

When you create a wallet:
1. A new keypair is generated **in your browser**
2. Only the public address is sent to our server
3. The private key is displayed **once** and never stored
4. If you lose the key, the wallet cannot be recovered

---

## Funding Your Wallet

After creating a wallet, you need to add USDC:

### Option 1: Transfer from Exchange

1. Copy your wallet address from the dashboard
2. Go to your exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
3. Withdraw USDC to Base network
4. Paste your wallet address
5. Confirm the withdrawal

### Option 2: Bridge from Another Chain

If you have USDC on Ethereum or another chain:

1. Use [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org) or a bridge aggregator
2. Bridge USDC from your source chain to Base
3. Send to your spending wallet address

### Option 3: Swap ETH to USDC

If you have ETH on Base:

1. Use [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) or similar DEX
2. Connect your spending wallet (import the private key)
3. Swap ETH for USDC

## Using with the SDK

Once funded, use your spending wallet with the SDK:

```typescript
import { SkillzMarket } from '@skillzmarket/sdk';

const market = new SkillzMarket({
  wallet: process.env.SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY, // Your spending wallet key
});

// Call a skill - payment is automatic
const result = await market.call('text-to-image', {
  prompt: 'A sunset over mountains',
});
```

### Environment Setup

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...your-private-key
```

The SDK automatically uses this key for x402 payments.

## Using with MCP Server

Configure your MCP client (Claude, etc.) with your spending wallet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillzmarket": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@skillzmarket/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY": "0x...your-private-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Managing Wallets

### View Balance

Your current balance is shown in the dashboard wallet tab. It's fetched from the Base blockchain in real-time.

### Edit Label

Give your wallet a friendly name:
1. Click the edit icon next to the label
2. Enter a name like "Production" or "Testing"
3. Click Save

### Generate New Wallet

If you lose your private key:
1. Click **Generate New Wallet**
2. Confirm you want to revoke the old wallet
3. Save the new private key
4. Transfer any remaining funds from the old address

Your old wallet still exists on-chain - only the association is removed.

### View History

Click **Wallet History** to see previously revoked wallets with their addresses and dates.

## Security Best Practices

### Do

- Store private key in a secure password manager
- Use environment variables, never hardcode
- Start with small amounts to test
- Keep spending wallet separate from main holdings

### Don't

- Share your private key
- Store in version control (add `.env` to `.gitignore`)
- Keep large amounts in spending wallet
- Use the same wallet for multiple purposes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Low balance" Warning

Your wallet has less than $1 USDC. Fund it to continue calling skills.

### "Payment failed"

- Check your balance covers the skill price
- Ensure you're on Base network (not Ethereum mainnet)
- Verify the private key is correct

### Lost Private Key

Unfortunately, there's no recovery possible. Generate a new wallet and transfer funds from the old address if you have access elsewhere.
