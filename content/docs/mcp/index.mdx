# MCP Integration

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) allows AI assistants to interact with external tools. The `@skillzmarket/mcp` package provides tools for discovering and calling paid AI skills directly from MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop.

## Why Use MCP?

- **Natural language interface** - Ask Claude to search for skills, check prices, and make calls
- **Automatic payments** - USDC payments on Base are handled transparently
- **No code required** - Use skills without writing any application code

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description | Requires Wallet |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `skillz_search` | Search the marketplace by name or description | No |
| `skillz_info` | Get detailed skill information including price | No |
| `skillz_call` | Call a skill with automatic USDC payment | Yes |
| `skillz_reviews` | Get reviews for a specific skill | No |

## Quick Start

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillzmarket": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@skillzmarket/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SKILLZ_PRIVATE_KEY": "0x..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your AI assistant:

> "Search Skillz Market for image generation skills"

> "Get info about the text-to-image skill"

> "Call text-to-image with prompt 'A sunset over mountains'"
